7045,125107,alex.mbugua123@gmail.com,Wrong contact,"Dear sir, I have not received any contact from the University by phone. I think there may be a problem in reaching me, cause I see you have written in the manner that you tried contacting me, when actually I have not. I'm sorry for the confusion, but please make sure that the records show that this "" +254717231795 "" is the contact that you have in the records. Thank you for trying to contact me and yes I am at par with the conditions set. Although there is one problem, you have asked for a receipt of my KCSE certificate, while I did IGCSE O'Levels . I hope this can be mended and will not cause a problem. I wish to hear back from you soon regarding the above issue and I am sorry for whatever was said when you tried contacting me, for that was not me on the phone. Kind regards, John Alex Mbugua.
